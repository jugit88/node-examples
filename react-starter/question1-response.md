### My View of Amazon's UX

Amazon is often described as the Walmart of the internet. They, along with [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/), are without question the world's most comprehensive
ecommerce sites. And while I believe Amazon does as well as one can formatting the UI so that products are easy to find, I find the 
homepage to be slightly overwhelming. I can only speak for myself and my circle of friends, but I personally only go visit Amazon when 
when I need specific things. One area I would focus more on is exploration. Amazon is vast and needs to be hiper organized, but if they 
put more emphasis on something more broad such as the 'featured' page similar to the App store or the [explore](https://github.com/explore) page on GitHub, I would perhaps
enjoy spending more time on the site.
